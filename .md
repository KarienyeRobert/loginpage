 ## PHP Login System with MySQL Database

This is a simple PHP login system that uses a MySQL database to store user information. The system allows users to login and logout, and displays a list of all registered users.

### Prerequisites

To use this system, you will need the following:

* A web server with PHP and MySQL support
* A MySQL database
* A text editor

### Installation

1. Create a MySQL database named `login`.
2. Import the `login.sql` file into the database.
3. Copy the `login` directory to your web server's document root.

### Usage

To use the login system, simply open the `index.php` file in a web browser. The login form will be displayed. Enter your username and password and click the "Login" button. If the login is successful, you will be redirected to the home page.

### Code Overview

The login system consists of the following files:

* `index.php`: The main login page.
* `login.php`: The script that processes the login form.
* `logout.php`: The script that logs the user out.
* `connection.php`: The script that establishes a connection to the MySQL database.
* `style.css`: The stylesheet for the login page.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file for the login page.

### Login Page

The login page (`index.php`) contains the following HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
   <div class="login">
    <div class="error" id="error"></div>
    <h1>Login</h1>
    <form name="form" id="form" action="login.php" method="post">
        <input name="userName" id="userName" class="input" type="text" placeholder="UserName">
        <input name="pass" id="password" class="input" type="password" placeholder="Password">
        <input name="submit" id="login" class="button" type="submit" value="Login">



 # PHP Login System with MySQL Database

This is a simple PHP login system that uses a MySQL database to store user information. The system allows users to login and access a protected page.

## Prerequisites

To use this login system, you will need the following:

* A PHP web server (such as Apache or Nginx)
* A MySQL database server
* A text editor (such as Sublime Text or Atom)

## Setup

To set up the login system, follow these steps:

1. Create a MySQL database and a table called `hello` with the following columns:
    * `id` (int, primary key)
    * `username` (varchar(255))
    * `password` (varchar(255))

2. Import the `connection.php` file into your project. This file contains the code to connect to the MySQL database.

3. Create a new PHP file called `index.php`. This file will contain the login form.

4. Add the following code to the `index.php` file:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Login System</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Login</h1>
    <form action="login.php" method="post">
        <label for="userName">Username:</label>
        <input type="text" id="userName" name="userName">
        <br>
        <label for="pass">Password:</label>
        <input type="password" id="pass" name="pass">
        <br>
        <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Login">
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

5. Create a new PHP file called `login.php`. This file will handle the login process.

6. Add the following code to the `login.php` file:

```php
<?php
include("connection.php");

if(isset($_POST['submit'])){
    $Username = $_POST['userName'];
    $password = $_POST['pass'];

    // Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM hello WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
    $stmt = $conn->prepare($sql);
    $stmt->bind_param("ss", $Username, $password);
    

 **Database Connection with PHP and MySQL: A Step-by-Step Guide**

This README file provides a detailed explanation of the PHP code for connecting to a MySQL database. The code is designed to be easy to understand, even for junior developers.

**Step 1: Establishing the Database Connection**

The first step is to establish a connection to the MySQL database. This is done using the `mysqli` extension in PHP. The following code snippet shows how to do this:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
$db_name = "database1"; // Corrected the database name
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $db_name);
?>
```

In this code, we specify the following information:

* `$servername`: This is the address of the MySQL server. In this case, we are using `localhost`, which means that the MySQL server is running on the same machine as the PHP script.
* `$username`: This is the username for the MySQL database. In this case, we are using `root`, which is the default username for MySQL.
* `$password`: This is the password for the MySQL database. In this case, we are using an empty string, which means that there is no password.
* `$db_name`: This is the name of the MySQL database that we want to connect to. In this case, we are using `database1`.

Once we have specified this information, we can use the `mysqli` constructor to establish the connection. If the connection is successful, the `$conn` variable will be a valid MySQL connection object. Otherwise, the `$conn->connect_error` property will contain an error message.

**Step 2: Handling Connection Errors**

It is important to handle connection errors gracefully. In the code above, we use the `if` statement to check if the `$conn->connect_error` property is set. If it is, we display an error message and exit the script. This prevents the script from continuing to execute if the connection to the database fails.

**Step 3: Closing the Database Connection**

Once we are finished using the database connection, it is important to close it. This can be done using the `close()` method of the `mysqli` object. The following code snippet shows how to do this:

```php
$
